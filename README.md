# dotfiles
My cross-functional config of tmux, vim, fish, and more, for work and home, Mac OSX, standard and ChromeOS-flavored linux

# How to use

## Debian and Pixelbook
Run `./setup-linux`

## MacOS
Run `./setup-macos`

### Current Issues

Since installing arm64 homebrew packages:

- tmux crashes on start
- `kubectl ctx` krew plugin crashes on start, though `kubectl ctx -c` does work
